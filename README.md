## Project Overview

In the healthcare domain, accurately forecasting patient health outcomes and trends within multilevel medical security systems is a complex task. This project introduces the **AI-Driven Neuro xLSTM model**, a cutting-edge enhancement of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, specifically designed for predictive health analysis.

### Key Features:

- **Matrix Memory Mechanism:** Captures long-term dependencies effectively.
- **Multi-Head Attention Module:** Highlights critical health-related features.
- **Healthcare-Specific Regularization:** Ensures alignment with realistic health outcomes.

This combination enables **Neuro xLSTM** to manage complex health data dynamics, surpassing traditional statistical and classical machine learning methods in both accuracy and interpretability.

### Research Highlights:

- The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple healthcare datasets, including:
  - **EHR (Electronic Health Records)**
  - **PublicHealth2K**
  - **MedIndicator**
- Demonstrates the potential to improve predictive health analysis and medical resource planning within multilevel medical security systems.
